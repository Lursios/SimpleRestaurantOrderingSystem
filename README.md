Built with Tailwind CSS & Next Js 14 with Mobile First Approach Design Principle. Made for a screening process to land a job which failed 

This is how it look for at first : 


I have only two weeks never used next js, typescript or tailwind and my react was ok but not great and i didn't know that there's a library for everything in react.
i know it's kinda bad but you got to start somewhere right ? 


The End Goal Will Be like this Figma Design :

The Customer Portal was made by me but the admin panel and other stuff was created by my dev friend this his github : https://github.com/irhamzh
He kinda stop and do another project that we're currently building that align with his interest here : https://github.com/irhamzh/stolen-builder

Link to other resources that was skillfully made by my friend but never resurface :
